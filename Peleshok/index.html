						<p>Quaint little alleys, cosy beer gardens or lively pavement cafés. Impressive mountain summits

								coffee with locals and chatted about everything and anything countless times
								before.</br></p>

							<p>Why is that? The answer might remain the market town’s little secret forever. One thing’s
								for sure, though: Hardly anyone can resist the rustic charm and the almost limitless
								variety of Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Everyone finds their personal holiday fulfilment
								here. While skiing or cross-country skiing. While hiking or biking.

							<p>A stroll through historic Garmisch is an engaging journey back in time. The farm houses

								the quaint little alleys and Lüftlmalerei mural paintings lining the Frühlingstraße.</p>

							<p>Walk past the Alte Kirche, a church from the 13th century, admire the historic flair of

								paintings, the Werdenfels Museum or Haus Simon!

						<p>Hello, we've just returned from a week in EveRest. We are well travelled skiers and boarders,
							and the conditions we've had are, some of the best in nearly 20 trips.
							We were a mixed group, with some novices, and there is plenty for them, there are loads of
							blue runs everywhere. For the advanced, there isn't so much on piste, but the off piste was
							incredible, so much untracked powder!
							Whilst I appreciate conditions change, I can only give you my experience. It snowed for 5
							out of 6 days, so the visibility was pretty poor for most of it.
							The lift systems are good and its easy to navigate.Food on the mountain was good and
							sensibly priced. Most places were around €5 for a large beer, so way cheaper than France.
							The town itself is just a street really, but still fairly pretty.
							We stayed in the Bergland, short walk to the shuttle (funicular), and then you ski down to
							the Gondola.
							All in all, I'd recommend it. With less snow, I may have had to go to Obergurgl as I get
							bored on piste, but didn't need to on this trip.
							One thing I'd really recommend you do is the tobogganing, its an absolute scream. Once you
							have a lift ticket, its only €9 to hire the toboggan, worth every cent.
							Irish bar, €6 for a guiness.
							People were lovely, and really helpful, considering we speak no German.
							All in all a great resort.</p>

							Well what a surprise! Skied in some of the big Ukrainian resorts and EveRest, together with
							Obergurgl and Hochgurgl, was just as good.
							The lift system is fast, efficient and modern. As well as the Giggijoch and Gaislachkogl
							mountains you've also got the 2 glaciers of Rettenbach and Tiefenbach, and that's before you
							even go over to Obergurgl/Hochgurgl!!
							We used Intersport Glanzer by the Gaislachkogl station for our ski and boot hire and I was
							impressed with the quality of the hire kit. My Rossignol skis were excellent.
							Nightlife and restaurants are very good and cater for most pockets.
							The snow was very good for end of March. Plenty of testing runs and all the slopes
							immaculately maintained.
							If you get across to Obergurgl, check out the Nederhutte apres ski bar on the slopes. You
							will not be disappointed!!! And they even skidoo you down for free if you've drunk too
							much!!
							Would certainly consider going again, certainly gets my vote!!</p>

								I was there for a whole week at the beginning of March. Being an overseas visitor with
								previous experiences in big name ski resorts around the world, I was frustrated with
								this Austrian icon. Soelden caters basically for German, Dutch and Belgian visitors,
								plus locals, who come by car with friends and family. Some room for Scandinavian and
								east Europeans, and that’s it. Very few brits and Americans.
								People ski basically mid-mountain up, relying on two big gondolas that leave from the
								village base.
								Lifts – Soelden is absolutely busy. I had never seen such a crowded place! It took me
								almost 40 minutes to ride up a lift one day, and I am not talking about weekends, bus a
								mid-week afternoon! And when I say crowded, expect the worst: ski crashes, people
								stumbling at each other, hurrying to place skis on gondolas racks, yelling at each
								other, children crying and so on. Looked like the end of the world! Politeness is not
								the rule here, and staff was totally passive. I remember when I went to the glacier,
								when I got there I felt just so exhausted of the adventure in all those lift rushes on
								the way up that I had to rest a little before skiing down.
